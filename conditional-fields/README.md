# DatoCMS Conditional fields plugin

A really simple plugin that show/hides fields when you toggle a checkbox boolean field.
Check the `invert` option if you want the plugin to act in the opposite way,
ie. show target fields when this boolean field is false.

## Configuration

When [applying this plugin to a boolean field](https://www.datocms.com/docs/plugins/install/#assigning-a-plugin-to-a-field), please insert the API identifiers of the fields you want to toggle, comma separated:
