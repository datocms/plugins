# DatoCMS Conditional fields plugin

A really simple plugin that show/hides fields when you toggle a checkbox boolean field.
Check the `invert` option if you want the plugin to act in the opposite way,
ie. show target fields when a source boolean field is unchecked.

## Configuration

When applying this plugin to a boolean field, please insert the API key of the fields you want to toggle, comma separated:
