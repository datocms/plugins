# Schema Import/Export

This plugin allows you to export one or multiple models/block models as JSON files, which can then be reimported into another DatoCMS project. It effectively manages any conflicts that may arise during the import process by directly guiding you on how to resolve them. Additionally, if your model fields necessitate any plugins, the export correctly incorporates them as well.
